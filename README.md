> On-chain party identity for [Sui](https://sui.io).

`miso_party` provides a reusable identity primitive for protocols that need to
represent people, groups, and organizations:

- **`Party`** — a named, capability-authorized identity that can represent an **individual** or a **group** of parties. Parties are extensible (other packages can attach data via dynamic fields) and own their lifecycle through a `PartyAdminCap`.

## Concepts

### Party

```move
let (party, cap) = party::new(party::new_individual_kind(), b"Ada".to_string(), ctx);
party.share(&cap); // make it a shared object
```

- Individual or group (`new_individual_kind()` / `new_group_kind()`); groups hold member party IDs.
- All mutations, including naming and consent-based group membership, require the appropriate `PartyAdminCap`.
- Extensible: holders of the cap can reach the party's `&mut UID` (`uid_mut`) to attach domain data.

## Install

```toml
[dependencies]
miso_party = { git = "https://github.com/misonetwork/party.git", rev = "<commit-sha>" }
```

Pin `rev` to the exact commit reviewed by your application. Party profile and
presentation slices live in
[misonetwork/party-extensions](https://github.com/misonetwork/party-extensions).

## TypeScript SDK

Party bindings, reads, and composable transaction builders are included in
[`@misonetwork/sdk`](https://github.com/misonetwork/sdk) and are exposed through
`client.miso.party`. This repository no longer publishes a separate TypeScript
package.

## Build & test
